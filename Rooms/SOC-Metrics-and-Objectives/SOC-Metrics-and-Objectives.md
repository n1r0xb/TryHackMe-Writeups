|Terminology|Definition|
|:---------:|----------|
|`EDR`      |Endpoint detection and response (EDR) is a series of tools that monitor devices for activity that could indicate a threat.|
|`MTTA`     |Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA) is the average time between the initial alert and the service provider (e.g. SOC L1 analysts) taking action.|
|`MTTD`     |Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) is the average time it takes for an organization to identify a security threat, incident, or a technical problem.|
|`MTTR`     |Mean Time to Response (MTTR) is the average time between the initial alert and response to it (e.g. malware removal, password reset, or system restore).|
|`SLA`      |Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a document signed between a service provider (e.g. SOC team) and its customer defining the uptime and quality requirements.|
|`SOAR`     |SOAR stands for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. It is a solution that helps organisations to streamline and automate their security operations, including incident management, threat intelligence, and vulnerability response.|
|`SOC`      |Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of IT security professionals tasked with monitoring, preventing , detecting , investigating, and responding to threats within a company’s network and systems.|

## `Core Metrics`

|**Metric**|**Formula**|**Measures**|
|:---------|:----------|:-----------|
|Alert Count          |`AC = Total Count of Alerts Received`   |Overall load of SOC analysts|
|False Positive Rate  |`FPR = False Positives / Total Alerts`  |Level of noise in the alerts|
|Alert Escalation Rate|`AER = Escalated Alerts / Total Alerts` |Experience of L1 analysts   |
|Threat Detection Rate|`TDR = Detected Threats / Total Threats`|Reliability of the SOC team |

---

**Alerts Count:** 5 to 30 alerts per day per L1 analyst is a good metric.

**False Positive Rate:** 0% is an unachievable ideal, but 80% or higher is a serious problem.

**Alert Escalation Rate:** Aimed to be below 50%, or even better - below 20%.

**Threat Detection Rate:** Should always be at 100%.

<b>*Q1: Imagine a scenario where the SOC team receives a critical alert on Saturday.
If the team works 8/5, on which day of the week will they acknowledge the alert?*</b>

<details>

  <code>Monday</code>

<b>*Q2: Imagine a scenario where an employee was lured into running data stealer malware.*</b>

  <b>*1. The SOC team received the "Connection to Redline Stealer C2" alert after 12 minutes.*</b>
  
  <b>*2. One of the L1 analysts on shift moved the alert to In Progress 10 minutes later.*</b>
  
  <b>*3. After 6 minutes, the alert was escalated to L2, who spent 35 minutes cleaning the malware.*</b>
  
  <b>*Provide the MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR via comma as your answer (e.g. 10,20,30).*</b>

## `Improving Metrics`

|**Issue**|**Recommendations**|
|:-------:|:------------------|
|`False Positive Rate over 80%`         |**Your team receives too much noise in the alerts. Try to:** <ul><li>Exclude trusted activities like system updates from your EDR or SIEM detection rules</li><li>Consider automating alert triage for most common alerts using SOAR or custom scripts</li></ul>|
|`Mean Time to Detect over 30 mins`     |**Your team detects a threat with a high delay. Try to:** <ul><li>Contact SOC engineers to make the detection rules run faster or with a higher rate</li><li>Check if SIEM logs are collected in real-time, without a 10-minute delay</li></ul>|
|`Mean Time to Acknowledge over 30 mins`|**L1 analysts start alert triage with a high delay. Try to:** <ul><li>Ensure the analysts are notified in real-time when a new alert appears</li><li>Try to evenly distribute alerts in the queue between the analysts on shift</li></ul>|
|`Mean Time to Respond over 4 hours`    |**SOC team can't stop the breach in time. Try to:** <ul><li>As L1, make everything possible to quickly escalate the threats to L2</li><li>Ensure your team has documented what to do during different attack scenarios</li></ul>|

|Terminology|Definition|
|:---------:|----------|
|`Alert`     |A notification generated by a security solution when a specific event or sequence of events occurs.|
|`EDR`       |Endpoint detection and response (EDR) is a series of tools that monitor devices for activity that could indicate a threat.|
|`Phising`   |When emails are sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information.|
|`SIEM`      |Security Information and Event Management system that is used to aggregate security information in the form of logs, alerts, artifacts and events into a centralized platform that would allow security analysts to perform near real-time analysis during security monitoring.|
|`SOAR`      |SOAR stands for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. It is a solution that helps organisations to streamline and automate their security operations, including incident management, threat intelligence, and vulnerability response.|
|`SOC`       |Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of IT security professionals tasked with monitoring, preventing, detecting, investigating, and responding to threats within a company’s network and systems.|

**Alert Management Platforms:**

|**Solution**|**Examples**|**Description**|
|:----------:|:-----------|:--------------|
|`SIEM System`|Splunk ES, Elastic|SIEM have solid alert management capabilities and are a perfect choice for most SOC teams|
|`EDR or NDR`|MS Defender, CrowdStrike|While EDR and NDR provide their own alert dashboards, it is preferred to use SIEM or SOAR|
|`SOAR System`|Splunk SOAR, Cortex SOAR|Bigger SOC teams can use SOAR to aggregate and centralise alerts from multiple solutions|
|`ITSM System`|Jira, TheHive|Some teams may have a custom ticket management (ITSM) setup using a dedicated solution|

## `Alert Prioritization`

**Alert Prioritization** is crucial to ensure timely detection of a threat, especially with many alerts in the queue.

**A Few Approaches:**
* `Filter the Alerts`
* `Sort by Severity`
* `Sort by Time`

---

<b>*Q1: Should you first prioritise medium over low severity alerts? (Yea/Nay)*</b>

`Yea`

<b>*Q2: Should you first take the newest alerts and then the older ones? (Yea/Nay)*</b>

`Nay`

<b>*Q3: Assign yourself to the first-priority alert and change its status to In Progress.
The name of your selected alert will be the answer to the question.*</b>

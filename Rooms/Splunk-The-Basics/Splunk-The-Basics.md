**Splunk Forwarder:** is a lightweight agent installed on the endpoint intended to be monitored, and its main task is to collect the data and send it to the Splunk instance.

**Splunk Indexer:** plays the main role in processing the data it receives from forwarders. It parses and normalizes the data into field-value pairs, categorizes it, and stores the results as events, making the processed data easy to search and analyze.

**Search Head:** is the place within the Search & Reporting App where users can search the indexed logs. Searches are done using SPL (Search Processing Language), a powerful query language for searching indexed data.

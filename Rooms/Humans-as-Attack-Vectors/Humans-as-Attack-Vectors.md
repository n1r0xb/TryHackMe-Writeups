|Terminology|Definition|
|:---------:|----------|
|`AI`       |Artificial Intelligence is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human behaviour, like learning and reasoning.|
|`EDR`      |Endpoint detection and response (EDR) is a series of tools that monitor devices for activity that could indicate a threat.|
|`Phishing` |When emails are sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information.|
|`Social Engineering`|The manipulation of individuals to divulge sensitive information, through various forms of communication.|
|`VPN`      |A Virtual Private Network is a way to create a secure "tunnel" between two networks. For example, you use a VPN on TryHackMe to access the private network on which the machines operate. VPNs are also commonly used for an employee to log into their workplace when they are not on site (such as working from home or travelling for business matters). VPNs are also used where networks (such as coffee shops) do not provide encryption, and are a great way of preventing others from reading your network traffic.|

## `Attacks on Humans`

**Social Engineering** is designed to be:
* `Trustworthy:` The attacker must appear legitimate so the victim trusts them.
* `Emotional:` The attack must trigger feelings like urgency, fear, or curiosity.

## `Defending Humans`

Defending against threats involves two key tasks: **Mitigation** and **Detection**.

|**Mitigation**|**Description**|
|:-------------|:--------------|
|Anti-phishing solution|SOC routine becomes easier with a tool that blocks phishing emails before the users even notice|
|Antivirus / EDR solution|A reliable antivirus on all corporate hosts is a great measure to prevent humans from running malware|
|"Trust but verify" principle|Instruct your employees how to detect deepfakes and verify suspicious requests from "CEO" or "IT"|
|Security awareness training|Teach your employees how to detect phishing and reinforce training through phishing simulations|

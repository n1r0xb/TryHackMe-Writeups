## `Most Common Blue Team Departments`

**Security Operations Center (SOC)** - This is where you are most likely to start your cyber security journey!

  Composed of the following roles:
  * **L1 Analysts:** Junior members who triage alerts and pass complex cases to L2.
  * **L2 Analysts:** Experienced members who investigate more advanced attacks.
  * **Engineers:** Experts in configuring security tools like EDR or SIEM.
  * **Manager:** A person who manages the whole SOC team.

**Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT)** - If SOC expertise is not enough or the incident goes out of control, you urgently call the "firefighters" - CIRT, also called CSIRT or CERT.

  Below are a few CIRT examples:
  * **JPCERT:** Japan's CERT handling nation-wide breaches.
  * **Mandiant:** A private team responding to global cyber incidents.
  * **AWS CIRT:** Investigates security incidents of AWS customers.

**Specialized Defensive Roles** - Large companies, technology-focused startups, and government agencies often require narrow and specialized Blue Team roles - exciting and highly valuable, but requiring deep topic knowledge and broad experience in broader fields like SOC or IT.
